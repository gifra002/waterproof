Monitoring programs of industrial cooling systems
I am 70 years old and I made in the past some programs with visual basic 6 concerning the monitoring of heat transfer unit in industrial plants.
Since I am a self made programmer may be software I made it is not surely not optimized. However, I believe that are valuable I wold like to share to improve the programs as structure optimization.
Valuable programs I have are 1) General heat exchangers monitoring, 2) Exaust steam condenser, 3) Cooling tower performance
To start I put the program "WaterProof HX"
