Monitoring programs of industrial cooling systems
I am 70 years old and I made in the past some programs with visual basic 6 concerning the monitoring of heat transfer unit in industrial plants.
Since I am a self made programmer may be software I made it is not surely not optimized. However, I believe that are valuable I wold like to share to improve the programs as structure optimization.
Valuable programs I have are 1) General heat exchangers monitoring, 2) Exaust steam condenser, 3) Cooling tower performance
To start I put the program "WaterProof HX"
Note: the Access database HX must be  in the folder c:\Program Files\WaterProof HX
I add the zip file for those want to download all files toghether, and all original files under relative folder as are in the original structure of VB6.
Overview
The program calculates the fouling factor of HEAT TRANSFER UNITS by computational analysis of the basic design and actual data. 
The purpose is to monitor the thermal efficiency of heat transfer units building the trends of the main significant parameters, that allow judging the operating conditions and efficiency of the heat transfer.
Trends of the main parameters may be selectively reported by plant, cooling tower, plant-unit and exchanger-unit. Period of the history trend may also be chosen.  Span of the chart may also adjusted accordingly to provide the optimal view of the trend. 
The program may be applied for any type of liquid/liquid coolers and some one-component full condensation. Characteristics are calculated for some fluids as Butane, 1-Butanol, Cyclohexane, Ethanol, Heptane, Hexane, Isobutane, Isopropanol, Methanol, Propylene Glycol, Benzene, Toluene, Ammonia, Propylene, VCM, Naphthalene,  Steam and Water.
However, the program is very flexible allowing choosing the calculated value or entering the real one for the main characteristics of the fluids. In such manner the program may be applied for any type of shell&tubes heat exchangers and process fluid.
